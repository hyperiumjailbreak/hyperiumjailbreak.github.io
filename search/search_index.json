If the mod just listens for a few events, you should be able to port it in 5-20 minutes. If it is medium sized, it may take around 45 minutes to complete. If the mod is extremely complex, (e.g. it uses ASM) it can take hours sadly. Porting \u00b6 First, you will need to get the sources for the mod you are porting. If the mod is open source, this is a good thing. Simply clone the source. If the mod is not open source, you will need to decompile it, and reconstruct it from there. See reconstruction . Next, open the sources you just got in IntelliJ IDEA. If Gradle is already set up, just replace the build.gradle file with the build.gradle from here .

Requirements \u00b6 To make an addon, you will first need the following things: At least 30 minutes (assuming this is your first time) The following software installed: Git IntelliJ IDEA (Community edition will do) JDK 8 (Don't want to make an Oracle account to download it? Just use ojdkbuild , built by the community.) Proficient knowledge of Java - this is crucial Getting Started \u00b6 Once you have all the needed software installed, go ahead and open IntelliJ IDEA, and select the \"Get from version control\" button. Type in the URL https://github.com/hyperiumjailbreak/Addon-Workspace , and clone it. Wait for the Gradle project to finish importing. Once it is complete, open the Gradle tab on the right, then the ForgeGradle category, and finally, double click setupDecompWorkspace . This will take a few minutes to complete. Next, let's learn about some core Hyperium concepts. Events \u00b6 A lot of things that can happen in the game are represented by events in the codebase. We have tons, such as ChatEvent , KeypressEvent , TickEvent , and RightMouseClickEvent . To listen for events, simply add the following code to any class: /* * This here is a comment, and is ignored by the computer. * * Name the void whatever you want, but make sure it is annotated with InvokeEvent, * because that tells HyperiumJailbreak this is an event listener. * * The event is the ONLY parameter the void will accept. Use whatever event you want to listen for's type. * e.g. this will be triggered on a chat event: */ @InvokeEvent public void onEventName ( ChatEvent e ) { System . out . println ( \"A chat message just happened!!\" ); // log to the console that it happened // ChatEvent has the chat message as one of it's properties, so we can access it: String theActualMessage = e . getChat (). getUnformattedMessage (); } You have now written an event listener. One thing to note: Hyperium won't actually search all classes for events unless you explicitly run: MyClassWithEventListener instance = new MyClassWithEventListener (); EventBus . INSTANCE . register ( instance ); Or, to make it stop listening for that class: EventBus . INSTANCE . unregister ( instance ); Configuration \u00b6 Sorry! This section is not done yet. Please check back later. addon.json \u00b6 The addon.json is a file that tells HyperiumJailbreak some of the information about it. The following fields are required : name (String): The addon's name. version (String): The current version of the addon. mainClass (String): The addon's main class. In addition, the following fields are optional: mixinConfigs (List of Strings): The names of any Mixin configuration files that should be registered. transformerClass (String): The addon's transformer class. Addon Main Class \u00b6 Every addon must have a main class. This is the class that will be loaded first. It will run all the addon's set-up, and register all the addon's events, keybinds, configuration options, and more. In the addon workspace, the main class is located in src/main/java/com/example/AddonExample.java . The main class has 2 methods you need to worry about: onLoad - This is called when the addon is loaded. onClose - This is called when the game is being shut down. Mixins \u00b6 Mojang's EULA states that we can't directly redistribute modified versions of Minecraft's source code. We get around that by simply changing the game's code at runtime through a framework called Mixin. You can read more about Mixin here . You can add Mixin classes to your addon by pointing to a Mixin configuration file in your addon.json : \"mixinConfigs\" : [ \"my-mixin-config.mixins.json\" ] Transformers \u00b6 This section is not yet done.

Note The purpose of this guide is to tell you the basics. This is exactly why this guide will never be complete. Starting off (Bootstrap) \u00b6 First, you are going to want to grab a copy of the latest IntelliJ IDEA build. After you download and install it, you are ready to start the in-IDE bootstrap phase. Click check out project from version control, and type in the URL to the client's Git repository. Hit okay. It will ask about importing the Gradle project. Click yes . It should auto-build. You can ignore this unless it fails. The next step is to prepare your workspace. Open the Gradle tab - it should be somewhere on screen (it will have an image of an elephant). Expand the forgegradle section. If you want to be able to view the decompiled code for Minecraft in addition to being able to run the client (assists with creating mixins), double click setupDecompWorkspace . If you just want to be able to run the client, double click setupDevWorkspace . Running the client \u00b6 To run the client in the development environment, you can execute the pre-made task called runClient . You can either do it in the Gradle tab under forgegradle , or in the run configurations dropdown. Where to find the configurations dropdown The configurations dropdown will be in the top right corner of the IDE by default. If for some reason our pre-made configurations aren't detected, it will say \"Add Configurations\". After starting the run process, the client should appear soon after. Creating a Mixin \u00b6 What is a Mixin ? In short terms, a Mixin is a class that allows changing/modifying/injecting code in to a target class that you don't have direct access to change it. This comes in handy when needing to manipulate dependencies, which in our case would be Minecraft mainly. Want a better definition then that? Go read about it here .
