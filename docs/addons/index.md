# Addons

Addons are a way of adding to or changing HyperiumJailbreak.

## Installing Addons

To install addons, follow this simple 3-step process:

1. Download the addon's `.jar` file.
2. Open your `.minecraft` folder, then open the `addons` sub-folder.
3. Move the `.jar` file into the addons `sub-folder`.

After install new addons, you will need to restart your game if it is already running.

!!! danger "Forge Mods"
    Addons are NOT Forge mods, and Forge mods are NOT addons.
    You can port Forge mods to addons if you know enough Java.

!!! warning "Addon Issues"
    Some addons made for normal Hyperium may not work on HyperiumJailbreak.
    If the developer has built the addon specifically targeting HyperiumJailbreak, this won't be a problem.
