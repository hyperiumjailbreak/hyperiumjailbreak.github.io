# Privacy

HyperiumJailbreak believes that privacy is a concept that cannot be ignored.
We have tried to give you as much privacy we can, but in some cases, data is shared.

## Analytics

* Minecraft - Minecraft includes analytics by default ("Snooper"), which before 3.0 is not modified. *After 3.0*, we modified this feature so that you can turn this off in the settings menu, and removed the specific GUI.
* HyperiumJailbreak team - When you start the client, it sends a request to our servers, only to update the player count. *This is fully anonymous except for your IP, which is processed by [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com)*.

### Third Party Addons

!!! warning
    *Some Third Party Addons do contain analytics*, such as Quickplay (which contains Google Analytics).
    We do not modify the addons, so the analytics may work if present.

## Functionality

* Levelhead Mod - Sends your UUID, username, and the mod version ID to Mitchell Katz's API in exchange for the mod to work. *(Disable the mod to prevent this.)*
* Autotip Mod - Sends your UUID, username, and Autotip statistics to the Autotip API so tipping actually works. *(Disable the mod to prevent this.)*
* Other Features - Will be listed here soon.

Thank you for understanding, and have a nice day.
