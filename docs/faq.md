# FAQ

??? question "When I press a key, the Quickplay GUI shows up! What do I do?"
    Running `/qp keybinds` and changing the bind should fix it.

??? question "How do I know this isn't a virus?"
    Our entire codebase is open-source.
    It can be found over on [GitHub](https://github.com/hyperiumjailbreak/client).

??? question "My FPS is really bad, how can I get more?"
    Turn on FPS mode, or reinstall the client
    (through the downloaded Jar file) with more RAM.

??? question "I like a certain Forge mod, how do I use it within the client?"
    Sadly, Forge mods do not work with HJB.
    If you know Java, feel free to port it
    to addon format using our APIs.
