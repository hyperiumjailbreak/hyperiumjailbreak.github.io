# FAQ

??? question "When I press a key, the Quickplay GUI shows up! What do I do?"
    Running `/qp keybinds` and changing the bind should fix it.

??? question "How do I know this isn't a virus?"
    Our entire codebase is open-source.
    It can be found over on [GitHub](https://github.com/hyperiumjailbreak/client).

??? question "My FPS is really bad, how can I get more?"
    Turn on FPS mode, or reinstall the client
    (through the downloaded Jar file) with more RAM.
    Turning on/off certain settings in the `Improvements` tab may also help!

??? question "I like a certain Forge mod, how do I use it within the client?"
    Sadly, Forge mods do not work with HJB.
    If you know Java, feel free to port it
    to addon format using our APIs.

??? question "How do I request a feature get added?"
    You can either create (or use an existing) GitHub
    account and open an issue by heading
    [here](https://github.com/hyperiumjailbreak/client/issues),
    or, you can [email the project team](mailto:me@rdil.rocks).
    Thank you for your feedback!

??? question "Does this client spy on me?"
    No, it does not! Unlike normal Hyperium, this client is built for privacy!
    For more details, see our [Privacy Policy](privacy.md).

??? question "My question isn't listed here! What do I do?"
    See the answer for the `"How do I request a feature get added?"`
    question.
