# Features

HyperiumJailbreak includes many useful features for Minecraft players:

* Many mods aimed to fine-tune your PvP experience
* **Easy-to-use** interfaces and menus
* Normal minecraft bugs and annoying features fixed, such as lagless screenshots, issues with mouse delay, portal bugs, and more!

## Exclusives

You may ask, why should I use HyperiumJailbreak over normal Hyperium?
Here is a list that speaks for itself:

* Privacy. HJB doesn't send nearly as much data to servers as normal Hyperium. Normal Hyperium sends tons analytics to the project owners, which we feel isn't right. We try our best not to collect data.
* Speed. Normal Hyperium is slow and bulky. We have removed over 20,000 lines of code that could slow down the client. We also have our very own new mode, which is called FPS mode!

If that isn't enough for you, contact the project team with your suggestions!

!!! info "Adding Custom Mods"
    Because HyperiumJailbreak isn't built on Forge, it can't run Forge mods.
    Some mods (like Quickplay), are already available as addons. (See [the addons page](./addons/index.md).)
