# Installing

Here is how to install HyperiumJailbreak:

## Prerequisites

* You must have Java 8 installed for this to work. (Search 'Java 8 download')
* You must have run vanilla 1.8.9 at least once before attempting to install.

## Step 1

First you will need to head over to [the releases section](https://github.com/hyperiumjailbreak/client/releases), and download the Jar file for whichever release you want. We suggest you use the latest.
You will need to download that Jar, and once you have done so, you need to run it.

!!! important
    If the Jar is opened up by WinRAR, 7-Zip, or a different file explorer program instead of just the installer window,
    you will need to download [JarFix](https://johann.loefflmann.net/en/software/jarfix/index.html#Download)
    and run that program before you proceed.

You should now open the downloaded Jar file. If you see the words 'Hyperium Installer', nice job. You can go to the next step.
If it opens a file explorer program like WinRAR, see the tooltip above (It says 'Important').

## Step 2

!!! note
    If the black window opened freezes on something about a manifest,
    just close the window, wait a minute, ensure you are connected to
    the internet, and try again. This fixes it most of the time.

Once you are in the Hyperium installer, you can proceed to configure it to your liking.

After finishing, open your Minecraft launcher and have fun :smile:
