# Addons

Addons are a way of adding or changing Hyperium(Jailbreak).

> ***Addons are now deprecated.***
> As a user, you don't need to do anything but keep your client up-to-date.
> Developers - please do *not* create new addons - add them to the client's main sources.

## Compatibility with Parent Client

!!! danger "Addon Issues"
    Unfortunatly, due to API changes, some addons made for normal Hyperium may not work on HyperiumJailbreak.

!!! tip
    The addons listed below have all been verified to work on a recent HyperiumJailbreak release.

## Verified Addon List

These addons have been checked over by the team and verified to work on a recent (stable) release:

* [Quickplay](https://hyperiumjailbreak.mycloudrepo.io/public/repositories/addons/Quickplay-Hyperium-2.0.3.jar)
* [Quickplay Premium](https://hyperiumjailbreak.mycloudrepo.io/public/repositories/addons/Quickplay_Premium_Hyperium-1.0.3.jar)
* [Fullscreen Addon (updated edition)](https://hyperiumjailbreak.mycloudrepo.io/public/repositories/addons/FullscreenAddon-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar)
* OptiFine

!!! info "Installing OptiFine"
    OptiFine can't be installed by dragging and dropping a file.
    You will need to enable it when using the installer.

## Deprecation Reasoning

!!! important "OptiFine Addon"
    Even after removal of addon support,
    OptiFine will **not** be removed.

Due to recent attempts to change certain ways addons behave,
it has been decided that addons do not currently work as well as they need to.
They are deprecated right now and may be removed in the future.
