# Pull Request Policy

Here at HyperiumJailbreak, we believe that pull requests should be dealt with in an orderly fashion.
That is why we have these guidelines for merging PRs:

1. Priority PRs first. Any PR that fixes a security issue or a very high priority issue *must* be the pull request dealt with first.
1. Combine code that is at least somewhat relevant together. We have learned that is not efficient anymore.
1. Please keep with style guides suggested to you by your IDE. We have style apps installed on GitHub to assist with this.

Thank you!
