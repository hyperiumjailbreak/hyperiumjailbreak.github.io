# The (In)complete Development Guide

Hello and welcome to the HyperiumJailbreak developer guide.

!!! note
    The purpose of this guide is to tell you
    the basics. This is exactly why this guide
    will never be complete.

## Starting Off (Bootstrap)

First, you are going to want to grab a copy of the latest [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) build.
After you download and install it, you are ready to start the in-IDE bootstrap phase.

Click check out project from version control, and type in the URL to the client's Git repository. Hit okay.
It will ask about importing the Gradle project. *Click yes*.
